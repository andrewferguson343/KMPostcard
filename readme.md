## Postcard Generator
I chose to develop the postcard generator because it is ain a similar application domain as what I usually build, 
but also had some requirements that were unlike any other projects I have developed before. I felt that in building this
app I could show my proficiency not only in creating applciations, but also in learning new skills within a short time frame.
I used the .Net framework to show my proficiency with the microsoft stack and backend programming.

## Using the Application

My application is built using microsoft technologies. All required libraries should be packaged within the application. To run, open the .sln file with visual studio or another .Net IDE and run. The page should open to the Index which contains the canvas and the form. Upload a file, choose text formatting options, then type text into the box and press enter. This will show the formatted text over the image. To send the image as an email, enter an email in the text box and click send. If the email is valid and the image is loaded, the message will be sent with the image as an attachment. The sent image will then be loaded into the history. click on an image in the history to restore that image to the canvas.

## Libraries

The only non-native libraries used are bootstrap v3.x and Jquery v3.3.1.
